<h2>Chapter 08 — Sorting</h2>
<img src="../sketches/08.svg" alt="pencil sketch">
<p>The Civic Center didn’t feel like safety.</p><p>It felt like sorting.</p><p>Cars were double-parked. Guards were shouting directions that kept changing. People were gripping phones that didn’t work.</p><p>One rule was said out loud once:</p><p>Names had to be added before check-in finished.
Once wristbands went on, the list locked.</p><p>No changes after that.</p><p>Most people nodded.</p><p>Most people didn’t really hear it.</p>
