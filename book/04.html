<p>My first instinct wasn’t fear.</p><p>It was you.</p><p>I was at the gym. Chalk on my hands. Music still playing. Someone asked me how many sets I had left. Everything looked normal.</p><p>I opened my phone and went straight to your name.</p><p>bubu / wifey</p><p>stay at your place. don’t go anywhere. i’ll come get you.</p><p>It didn’t send.</p><p>Weeks earlier, I’d said it as a joke.</p><p>“If anything ever happens,” I told you, “don’t move. Stay where you are. I’ll come get you.”</p><p>Standing there, it didn’t feel like a joke anymore.</p><p>It felt like a promise that had just come due.</p>
